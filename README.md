# Simple Network Simulator
## General Info
This project made up the scoring function of a reinforcement learning algorithm used to determine the optimal placement of network nodes in some topology.
Arrangements of nodes were scored based on the average number of hops from one node to another and the minimum number of hops needed to traverse all nodes.
Thsese scores were calculated using depth and breadth first traversals of a tree generated using a set of points (generated by `data.py`) representing nodes and a cutoff representing the distance beyond which nodes are unable to communicate.
## Usage
The project can be compiled and run through the following command in a bash shell<br/>
`./run.sh` <br/>
